                <h2>Assisted with the Design of the Aquatech Program</h2>
                <p><strong>AquaTech</strong>is designed to prepare you to operate a pool or aquatic facility according
                    to U.S. and international training requirements. Using a combination of online study and on-site
                    competency testing, the AquaTech certification course offers a flexible alternative to
                    classroom-only certification methods with the following benefits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User-friendly, non-intimidating training.</strong>AquaTech helps you master the
                        fundamentals of aquatic facility care through clear, simple explanations of the key concepts.
                        Rather than just working through pages of math problems, you’ll learn the hows and whys behind
                        the essential procedures, resulting in a more thorough understanding of the job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developed by industry leaders.</strong>AquaTech was designed with the help of experts
                        who understand the changing needs of today’s aquatic facilities. These people include Robert
                        Burrows, Tom Carrico, Robert Clayton, Juliene Hefter, Mick Nelson, Jill White, and Kent
                        Williams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful interactive online instruction.</strong>The course is more than just book
                        content presented online. It takes students step by step through a typical work day to help
                        them connect important concepts to real-world practice. Participants will work through
                        interactive scenarios based around situations they’re likely to face on the job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outstanding study and reference materials.</strong>The AquaTech text features
                        full-color photographs and reader-friendly elements such as margin notes, best practices
                        tables, and step-by-step instructions for common pool issues. Included with each book is the
                        AquaTech Pool Tool, a handy laminated reference card that features formulas, conversions,
                        charts, and calculation tips. Both resources will be valuable tools even after the course is
                        completed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The AquaTech online course will teach you how pool systems work and how to maintain them, as well as
                    how to diagnose, prevent, and solve common pool care troubles. You’ll also find information on
                    reducing risk and increasing safety at your facility. After completing the course, you’ll have all
                    the requisite competencies to successfully operate a pool or other aquatic facility.</p>
                <p>Following successful completion of the online course, students take part in an instructor-led
                    session. Successful completion of the instructor-led session leads to certification.*</p>
                <p style=" font-style: italic;">*Certification requirements may vary. Some cities, counties, or states
                    only require the online component for certification. Please consult your local code or contact us
                    for details regarding requirements in your area.</p>
                <h3>Words of Praise</h3>
                <p style=" font-style: italic;">Becoming AquaTech certified is a great way for any aquatics, park or
                    recreation professional to expand their career horizons. Pool management and operations are an
                    integral part of many positions, and this certification will assist you with obtaining the
                    necessary knowledge to operate a facility efficiently and successfully.</p>
                <p style=" font-style: italic;"> The online course that accompanies AquaTech is truly an interactive
                    experience - it's not just a book and some math problems delivered via the internet. It virtually
                    takes the student through the day to day experiences of a pool operator and the situations that may
                    present themselves.</p>
