                <p>Juliene, Thank you so much for the valuable information that was shared at the MRPA Conference this past week.  The aquatic sessions were awesome!  Please send me all of the updates of the Aquatic Sessions.  I will certainly be using those in the very near future.  If possible could I also get a copy of the contents of Aquatic Handbook.  This is a piece that I desperately to get get updated in the very near future.  Thanks again for sharing at the conference.</p>

                <p>My name is Megan Wuerth. I am an assistant aquatics coordinator at the Charlevoix Area Community Pool in Charlevoix, MI. I just recently attended some of your aquatics sessions at the MRPA conference in Traverse City, MI. Your sessions were very eye opening and inspiring. Our pool currently has a system in place for documenting accidents, but we are lacking a lot in the way of documentation. I think your sessions will really help us make some very necessary changes at our facility. I appreciate your time.</p>

                <p>Juliene,  I attended your first two sessions on Wednesday at the MRPA Conference. Thank you for taking the time to do these presentations. They were most beneficial. Your information will be most beneficial in assisting us in becoming a safer (and better documented) facility. Thank you again.</p>
